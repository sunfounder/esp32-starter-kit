Video 30: Servo Control with MQTT
=================================================================

Learn how to control servo motors remotely over Wi-Fi using an ESP32 microcontroller and MQTT protocol, from setting up MQTT with Adafruit IO to wiring the servo and programming the ESP32.

* **Servo Motor Control**: Control the position of a servo motor remotely with an ESP32 microcontroller.
* **Introduction to MQTT**: Understand MQTT protocol's lightweight, bidirectional, and scalable nature, essential for IoT applications.
* **Setting Up Adafruit IO**: Step-by-step guide to creating an account, setting up a dashboard, and configuring MQTT feeds for communication.
* **Wiring the Servo Motor**: Learn how to wire the servo motor to the ESP32 and external power supply.
* **Explaining the Code**: Understand the Arduino code for ESP32, including Wi-Fi and MQTT setup, servo motor control, and error handling.
* **Project Demonstration**: See the project in action, controlling the servo motor remotely over Wi-Fi and MQTT, with a demonstration of the need for an external power supply for the servo.
