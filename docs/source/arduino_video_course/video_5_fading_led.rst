Video 5: LED Fade - Controlling LED Brightness
=======================================================

This tutorial covers controlling LED brightness by fading in or out using the SunFounder ESP32 module:

* **LED Brightness Control**: Explains controlling LED brightness using PWM (Pulse Width Modulation). Discusses digital signals, duty cycles, and how varying duty cycles control LED brightness.
* **Wiring Diagram and Setup**: Provides a detailed wiring diagram for connecting an LED with a 220 Ohm resistor to the ESP32. Demonstrates the physical setup on a breadboard.
* **Code Explanation**: Describes the Arduino code for fading an LED. Covers functions like ``ledcSetup``, ``ledcAttachPin``, and ``ledcWrite``, explaining parameters and usage.
* **Practical Demonstration**: Shows how to upload the code to ESP32, check the wiring, and observe the LED fading effect. Tips for adjusting fade speed and brightness levels.

This comprehensive guide is ideal for beginners to learn about LED control with ESP32, offering step-by-step instructions, code details, and practical demonstrations.
