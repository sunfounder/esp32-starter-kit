Video 7: Arrays and Loops in Arduino Programming
=========================================================

This tutorial is designed to provide a thorough understanding of using arrays and loops in Arduino programming, specifically tailored for beginners using the ESP32 module.

* **Introduction to Arrays**: Explains what an array is, how to define it with multiple values, and how to access and modify its elements.
* **Defining and Filling Arrays**: Shows how to define an empty array with a predefined size and fill it with values using indexes.
* **Using Loops with Arrays**: Introduces different types of loops - for loop, while loop, and do-while loop - and their usage in accessing and modifying array elements.
    - **For Loop**: Demonstrates iterating over an array's elements, with detailed explanation on the loop's structure and incrementing index.
    - **While Loop**: Explains the while loop that executes code blocks based on a condition and showcases decrementing a value until a condition is met.
    - **Do-While Loop**: Focuses on do-while loop which ensures the code block is executed at least once before checking the condition.

* **Practical Examples**: Includes examples on updating array values, printing all elements of an array, and using conditional statements within loops.
