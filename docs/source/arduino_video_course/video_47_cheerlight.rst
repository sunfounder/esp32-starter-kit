Video 47: CheerLights
=================================================

Learn how to create an IoT CheerLights system using an ESP32 microcontroller, enabling synchronized color changes globally through MQTT communication.

* **MQTT Communication**: Understand how MQTT works for subscribing to feeds and receiving information, demonstrated with the CheerLights feed.
* **Hardware Setup**: Learn how to connect the ESP32 microcontroller with the camera extension module and WS2812 LED lights.
* **Library Installation**: Install necessary libraries for MQTT communication and controlling WS2812 LEDs in the Arduino IDE.
* **Coding**: Explore the code for setting up Wi-Fi, connecting to MQTT server, handling messages, and changing LED colors accordingly.
* **Board and Port Selection**: Get instructions on selecting the ESP32 Dev board and the correct port in the Arduino IDE.
* **Demonstration**: See a demo of the CheerLights system in action, including local and global color changes through MQTT and monitoring via the serial monitor.
