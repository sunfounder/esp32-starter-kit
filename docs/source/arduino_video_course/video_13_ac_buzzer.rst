Video 13: Arduino Beep with Active Buzzer
========================================================================================

Here, you will learn how to use an active buzzer with the ESP32 module for generating sound:

* **Active Buzzer Introduction**: Learn to control an active buzzer using a transistor. The buzzer emits sound when powered up.
* **Buzzer Components**: The tutorial uses an active buzzer, a 1K resistor, jumper wires, and an S8050 transistor.
* **Wiring and Schematic**: Understand the wiring schematic for connecting the buzzer to the ESP32.
* **Buzzer Specifications**: The active buzzer operates within a voltage range of 3 to 8 volts and has an internal oscillating frequency of around 2700 Hz.
* **Arduino Programming**: The tutorial covers the setup, loop functions, and how to control the buzzer using digital signals.
* **Interactive Project**: The project demonstrates how to generate a beeping sound with the buzzer, controlled by the ESP32.
* **Demonstration**: Once the code is uploaded, the ESP32 module activates the buzzer, producing a beeping sound.
