Video 35: Plant Monitor
====================================================

This tutorial demonstrates how to build a smart plant monitoring system using an ESP32 board, which measures temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and light, and displays the data on an LCD. It also includes a manual water pump control feature.

* **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Utilizes DHT11, soil moisture sensor, and LDR to monitor plant health indicators.
* **LCD Display Integration**: Shows real-time data readings on an LCD screen for easy monitoring.
* **Water Pump Control**: Includes a manual push button to activate a water pump for plant watering.
* **ESP32 and Component Overview**: Explains the functionality of each component and their integration.
* **Practical Demonstration**: Shows the system in action, providing a clear example of its capabilities.
* **Arduino Code and Setup**: Walks through the Arduino code required for the project, including setup and sensor readings.
