Video 31: Flowing Light
====================================================

Learn how to create an interactive flowing light effect using a WS2812 LED strip, controlled by an ESP32 board and reacting to obstacles with color changes.

* **WS2812 LED Strip Control**: Using ESP32 to individually control the colors and patterns of an LED strip.
* **Infrared Obstacle Avoidance**: Integration of an obstacle sensor to dynamically change the light pattern upon detection.
* **Arduino IDE and Libraries**: Guidance on installing the Adafruit NeoPixel library and setting up the Arduino environment for ESP32.
* **Sensor Adjustment**: Detailed instructions on adjusting the infrared obstacle sensor for optimal performance.
* **Dynamic Light Interaction**: Demonstrating how the LED strip changes direction and color based on obstacle detection.
* **Code Customization**: Tips on modifying the code to customize the LED response, including setting specific colors for certain conditions.
