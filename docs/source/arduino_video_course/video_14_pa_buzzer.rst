Video 14: Playing Custom Music Note
==========================================

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to use the SunFounder ESP32 IoT Learning Kit to play custom musical notes:

* **Passive Buzzer Introduction**: Unlike the previous tutorial with an active buzzer, this one uses a passive buzzer which requires an external signal for sound generation.
* **Wiring Guide**: Detailed instructions to correctly wire the passive buzzer to the ESP32 module.
* **Buzzer Specifications**: The passive buzzer operates on 3 to 5 volts and can produce varying tones based on the input signal frequency.
* **Arduino Code Overview**: The tutorial explains how to write and upload code to ESP32 for generating different musical notes through PWM signals.
* **Musical Note Project**: Create a setup to play a series of musical notes with the passive buzzer controlled by ESP32.
* **Project Execution**: Demonstrates the playing of musical notes once the code is successfully uploaded to the ESP32 module.
