2.12 GAME - Inflating the Balloon
=========================================

Here, we will play a game of ballooning.

After clicking the green flag, the balloon will become bigger and bigger. If the balloon is too big, it will be blown up; if the balloon is too small, it will fall down; you need to judge when to press the button to make it fly upwards.

Build the Circuit
-----------------------

The button is a 4-pin device, since the pin 1 is connected to pin 2, and pin 3 to pin 4, when the button is pressed, the 4 pins are connected, thus closing the circuit.

Build the circuit according to the following diagram.

* Connect one of the pins on the left side of the button to pin14, which is connected to a pull-down resistor and a 0.1uF (104) capacitor (to eliminate jitter and output a stable level when the button is working).
* Connect the other end of the resistor and capacitor to GND, and one of the pins on the right side of the button to 5V.

Programming
------------------

**1. Add a sprite and a backdrop**

Delete the default sprite, click the **Choose a Sprite** button in the lower right corner of the sprite area, then select the **Balloon1** sprite.

.. image:: img/13_balloon1.png

Add a **Boardwalk** backdrop via the **Choose a backdrop** button, or other backbackdrops you like.

.. image:: img/13_balloon2.png

**2. Paint a costume for the Balloon1 sprite**

Now let's draw an exploding effect costume for the balloon sprite.

Go to the **Costumes** page for the **Balloon1** sprite, click the **Choose a Costume** button in the bottom left corner, and select **Paint** to bring up a blank **Costume**.

.. image:: img/13_balloon7.png

Select a color and then use the **Brush** tool to draw a pattern.

.. image:: img/13_balloon3.png

Select a color again, click the Fill tool, and move the mouse inside the pattern to fill it with a color.

.. image:: img/13_balloon4.png

Finally, write the text BOOM, so that an explosion effect costume is complete.

**3. Scripting the Balloon sprite**

Set the initial position and size of the **Balloon1** sprite.

.. image:: img/13_balloon6.png

Then let the **Balloon** sprite slowly get bigger.

.. image:: img/13_balloon8.png

When the button is pressed (value is 1), the size of the **Balloon1** sprite stops getting bigger.

* When the size is less than 90, it will fall (y coordinate decreases).
* When the size is bigger than 90 and smaller than 120, it will fly to the sky (y coordinate increases).

.. image:: img/13_balloon9.png

If the button has not been pressed, the balloon slowly gets bigger and when the size is bigger than 120, it will explode (switch to the explode effect costume).
