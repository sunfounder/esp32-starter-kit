5.11 Toggle the Joystick
================================

If you play a lot of video games, then you should be very familiar with the Joystick.
It is usually used to move the character around, rotate the screen, etc.

The principle behind Joystick's ability to allow the computer to read our actions is very simple.
It can be thought of as consisting of two potentiometers that are perpendicular to each other.
These two potentiometers measure the analog value of the joystick vertically and horizontally, resulting in a value (x,y) in a planar right-angle coordinate system.


The joystick of this kit also has a digital input, which is activated when the joystick is pressed.

**Schematic**

|sch_joystick|

The SW pin is connected to a 10K pull-up resistor, the reason is to be able to get a stable high level on the SW pin (Z axis) when the joystick is not pressed; otherwise the SW is in a suspended state and the output value may vary between 0/1.

**Code**

.. note::

    * Open the ``5.11_joystick.py`` file located in the ``esp32-ultimate-kit\micropython\codes`` path, or copy and paste the code into Thonny. Then, click "Run Current Script" or press F5 to execute it.
    * Make sure to select the "MicroPython (ESP32).COMxx" interpreter in the bottom right corner. 

.. code-block:: python

    from machine import ADC,Pin
    import time

    xAxis = ADC(Pin(34, Pin.IN)) # create an ADC object acting on a pin      
    xAxis.atten(xAxis.ATTN_11DB)
    yAxis = ADC(Pin(35, Pin.IN)) # create an ADC object acting on a pin      
    yAxis.atten(yAxis.ATTN_11DB)
    button = Pin(33, Pin.IN)

    while True:
        xValue = xAxis.read()  # read a raw analog value in the range 0-4095
        yValue = yAxis.read()  # read a raw analog value in the range 0-4095
        btnValue = button.value()
        print(f"X:{xValue}, Y:{yValue}, Button:{btnValue}")
        time.sleep(0.1)

When the program runs, the Shell prints out the x, y, and button values of joystick.

.. code-block:: 

    X:1921, Y:1775, Button:0
    X:1921, Y:1775, Button:0
    X:1923, Y:1775, Button:0
    X:1924, Y:1776, Button:0
    X:1926, Y:1777, Button:0
    X:1925, Y:1776, Button:0
    X:1924, Y:1776, Button:0


* The x-axis and y-axis values are analog values that vary from 0 to 4095.
* The button is a digital value with a status of 1(release) or 0(press).
