6.4 Reversing Aid
======================

As science and technology continue to advance, numerous high-tech features have been integrated into cars. One such feature is the reversing assist system. In this project, we utilize an ultrasonic module, LCD, and buzzer to create a simple yet effective ultrasonic reversing assist system.


**Schematic**

The ultrasonic sensor emits high-frequency sound waves and measures the time it takes for the waves to bounce back after hitting an object. Using this information, the distance between the sensor and the object can be calculated. The buzzer is used to provide an audible signal when the object is too close, and the LCD screen displays the distance measurement.

.. note::

    * Open the ``6.4_reversing_aid.py`` file located in the ``esp32-ultimate-kit\micropython\codes`` path, or copy and paste the code into Thonny. Then, click "Run Current Script" or press F5 to execute it.
    * Make sure to select the "MicroPython (ESP32).COMxx" interpreter in the bottom right corner. 

    * For detailed tutorials, please refer to :ref:`open_run_code_py`.

        # Check if it's time to beep
        currentMills = time.ticks_ms()

* When the script is running, the ultrasonic module will continuously detect the distance of obstacles in front of it, and display the distance on the Shell and I2C LCD1602. 
* As the obstacle gets closer, the beeping frequency of the buzzer will become more rapid.
* The ``ultrasonic_thread()`` function runs in a separate thread so that it can update the distance measurement continuously without blocking the main loop.

.. note:: 

    If the code and wiring are correct, but the LCD still fails to display any content, you can adjust the potentiometer on the back to increase the contrast.
