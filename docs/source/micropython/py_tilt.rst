5.2 Tilt It！
==========================

|img_tilt|

The tilt switch is a 2-pin device with a metal ball in the middle. When the switch is upright, the two pins are connected; when it is tilted, the two pins are disconnected.

**Bill of Materials**

In this project, we need the following components. 

It's definitely convenient to buy a whole kit, here's the link:

**Schematic**

|sch_tilt|

When you put it upright, pin14 will get high; after tilting it, pin14 will get low.

The purpose of the 10K resistor is to keep the pin14 in a stable low state when the tilt switch is in a tilted state.

**Wiring**

|wiring_tilt|

开关引脚接14，同侧引脚接10K电阻之后接GND，另外一侧接3.3V.
LED接26.

**Code**

.. note::

    * Open the ``5.2_tilt_switch.py`` file located in the ``esp32-ultimate-kit\micropython\codes`` path, or copy and paste the code into Thonny. Then, click "Run Current Script" or press F5 to execute it.
    * Make sure to select the "MicroPython (ESP32).COMxx" interpreter in the bottom right corner. 

    * For detailed tutorials, please refer to :ref:`open_run_code_py`.

.. code-block:: python

    import machine
    import time

    switch = machine.Pin(14, machine.Pin.IN) # Tilt switch pin
    led = machine.Pin(26, machine.Pin.OUT) # LED pin

    while True:
        # Check if the switch is tilted by reading its value
        if switch.value() == 1:
            # Turn on the LED by setting its value to 1
            led.value(1)
        else:
            # Turn off the LED
            led.value(0)

When the script is running, the LED will be turned on when the switch is upright, and turned off when the switch is tilted.
