4.2 Pumping
=======================

In this intriguing project, we will delve into controlling a water pump using the L293D.

In the realm of water pump control, things are a bit simpler compared to controlling other motors. The beauty of this project lies in its simplicity - there's no need to worry about the direction of rotation. Our primary goal is to successfully activate the water pump and keep it running.

**Required Components**

In this project, we need the following components. 

It's definitely convenient to buy a whole kit, here's the link:

**Available Pins**

Here is a list of available pins on the ESP32 board for this project.

    * - Available Pins
      - IO13, IO12, IO14, IO27, IO26, IO25, IO33, IO32, IO15, IO2, IO0, IO4, IO5, IO18, IO19, IO21, IO22, IO23

**Wiring**

.. note::

    It is recommended here to insert the battery and then slide the switch on the expansion board to the ON position to activate the battery supply.

**Code**

.. note::

    * Open the ``4.2_pumping.py`` file located in the ``esp32-starter-kit-main\micropython\codes`` path, or copy and paste the code into Thonny. Then, click "Run Current Script" or press F5 to execute it.
    * Make sure to select the "MicroPython (ESP32).COMxx" interpreter in the bottom right corner. 



.. code-block:: python

    import machine
    import time

    # Create Pin objects representing the motor control pins and set them to output mode
    motor1A = machine.Pin(13, machine.Pin.OUT)
    motor2A = machine.Pin(14, machine.Pin.OUT)

    # Define a function to rotate the pump
    def rotate():
        motor1A.value(1)
        motor2A.value(0)

    # Define a function to stop the pump
    def stop():
        motor1A.value(0)
        motor2A.value(0)

    try:
        while True:
            rotate()  # Rotate the motor clockwise
            time.sleep(5)  # Pause for 5 seconds
            stop()  # Stop the motor
            time.sleep(2)

    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        stop()  # Stop the motor when KeyboardInterrupt is caught




During the script execution, you will see the pump working and water coming out of the tube, then stopping for 2 seconds before starting to work again.
