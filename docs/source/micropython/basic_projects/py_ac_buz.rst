3.1 Beep
==================
This is a simple project to make an active buzzer beep quickly four times every second.


**Available Pins**

Here is a list of available pins on the ESP32 board for this project.

.. list-table::
    :widths: 5 20 

    * - Available Pins
      - IO13, IO12, IO14, IO27, IO26, IO25, IO33, IO32, IO15, IO2, IO0, IO4, IO5, IO18, IO19, IO21, IO22, IO23


**Schematic**

    :width: 500
    :align: center

When the IO14 output is high, after the 1K current limiting resistor (to protect the transistor), the S8050 (NPN transistor) will conduct, so that the buzzer will sound.

The role of S8050 (NPN transistor) is to amplify the current and make the buzzer sound louder. In fact, you can also connect the buzzer directly to IO14, but you will find that the buzzer sound is smaller.

**Wiring**


Two types of buzzers are included in the kit. 
We need to use active buzzer. Turn them around, the sealed back (not the exposed PCB) is the one we want.

The buzzer needs to use a transistor when working, here we use S8050 (NPN Transistor).

**Code**

.. note::

    * Open the ``3.1_beep.py`` file located in the ``esp32-ultimate-kit-main\micropython\codes`` path, or copy and paste the code into Thonny. Then, click "Run Current Script" or press F5 to execute it.
    * Make sure to select the "MicroPython (ESP32).COMxx" interpreter in the bottom right corner. 




.. code-block:: python

    import machine
    import time

    # Create a Pin object representing pin 14 and set it to output mode
    buzzer = machine.Pin(14, machine.Pin.OUT)

    # Enter an infinite loop
    while True:
        # Iterate over the values 0 to 3 using a for loop
        for i in range(4):
            # Turn on the buzzer by setting its value to 1
            buzzer.value(1)
            # Pause for 0.2 seconds
            time.sleep(0.2)
            # Turn off the buzzer
            buzzer.value(0)
            # Pause for 0.2 seconds
            time.sleep(0.2)
        # Pause for 1 second before restarting the for loop
        time.sleep(1)



When the script is running, the buzzer will beep quickly four times every second.
