6.6 Digital Dice
================================

This project builds upon the :ref:`py_7_segment` project by adding a button to control the digit displayed on the seven-segment display.

When the button is pressed, the 7-segment display scrolls through the numbers 1-6, and when the button is released, it displays a random number.

This cycle continues each time the button is pressed.

**Required Components**

In this project, we need the following components. 

It's definitely convenient to buy a whole kit, here's the link:

**Schematic**

.. image:: ../../img/circuit/circuit_6.6_electronic_dice.png

This project builds upon the :ref:`py_7_segment` project by adding a button to control the digit displayed on the seven-segment display.

The button is directly connected to IO13 without an external pull-up or pull-down resistor because IO13 has an internal pull-up resistor of 47K, eliminating the need for an additional external resistor.

**Code**

.. note::

    * Open the ``6.6_digital_dice.py`` file located in the ``esp32-starter-kit-main\micropython\codes`` path, or copy and paste the code into Thonny. Then, click "Run Current Script" or press F5 to execute it.
    * Make sure to select the "MicroPython (ESP32).COMxx" interpreter in the bottom right corner.

            num = random.randint(1, 6)
            time.sleep_ms(10) # Adjust this value to control the display refresh rate
        
While the program is running, pressing the button will make the 7-segment display scroll and randomly display a number between 1 and 6. 

Upon pressing the button again, the 7-segment display will stop and reveal a specific number. Press the button once more, and the 7-segment display will resume scrolling through the digits.
