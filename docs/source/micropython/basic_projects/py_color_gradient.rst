**Schematic**

This project uses an LED strip and a potentiometer to create a color mixing effect. The potentiometer is used to adjust the hue value of the LED, which is then converted into RGB values using a color conversion function. The RGB values are then used to update the color of the LED.

**Code**

.. note::

    * Open the ``6.5_color_gradient.py`` file located in the ``esp32-starter-kit-main\micropython\codes`` path, or copy and paste the code into Thonny. Then, click "Run Current Script" or press F5 to execute it.
    * Make sure to select the "MicroPython (ESP32).COMxx" interpreter in the bottom right corner.

        return (int(r * 255), int(g * 255), int(b * 255))

    # Function to set the color of all LEDs in the strip
    def set_color(np, color):
        for i in range(NUM_LEDS):
            np[i] = color
        np.write()

    # Main loop
    while True:
        # Read the potentiometer value and normalize it to the range [0, 1]
        pot_value = potentiometer.read() / 4095.0
        hue = pot_value  # Set hue value based on the potentiometer's position
        saturation = 1  # Set saturation to 1 (fully saturated)
        lightness = 0.5  # Set lightness to 0.5 (halfway between black and white)

        # Convert the HSL color to RGB
        current_color = hsl_to_rgb(hue, saturation, lightness)
        
        # Set the LED strip color based on the converted RGB value
        set_color(np, current_color)
        
        # Sleep for a short period to allow for smooth transitions
        time.sleep(0.1)



As the code runs, slowly rotate the potentiometer and you will see the color of the RGB Strip fade from red to purple.
