**About 5V Enable Cap**

The L298N Motor Driver module consists of an L298 Motor Driver IC, 78M05 Voltage Regulator, resistors, capacitor, Power LED, 5V jumper in an integrated circuit.

78M05 Voltage regulator will be enabled only when the jumper is placed. When the power supply is less than or equal to 12V, then the internal circuitry will be powered by the voltage regulator and the 5V pin can be used as an output pin to power the microcontroller. 

The jumper should not be placed when the power supply is greater than 12V and separate 5V should be given through 5V terminal to power the internal circuitry.
