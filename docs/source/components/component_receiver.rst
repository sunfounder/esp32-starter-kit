An infrared-receiver is a component which receives infrared signals and can independently receive infrared rays and output signals compatible with TTL level. It is similar with a normal plastic-packaged transistor in size and is suitable for all kinds of infrared remote control and infrared transmission.

Infrared, or IR, communication is a popular, low-cost, easy-to-use wireless communication technology. Infrared light has a slightly longer wavelength than visible light, so it is imperceptible to the human eye - ideal for wireless communication. A common modulation scheme for infrared communication is 38KHz modulation.
