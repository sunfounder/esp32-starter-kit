6.4 Digital Dice
=============================

This project builds upon the :ref:`py_7_segment` project by adding a button to control the digit displayed on the seven-segment display.

In this project, a random number is generated and displayed on the seven-segment display to simulate a dice roll. When the button is pressed, a stable number (randomly selected from 1 to 6) is displayed on the seven-segment display. Pressing the button again will initiate the simulation of a dice roll, generating random numbers as before. This cycle continues each time the button is pressed.

**Required Components**

In this project, we need the following components. 

It's definitely convenient to buy a whole kit, here's the link:

**Schematic**

.. image:: ../../img/circuit/circuit_6.6_electronic_dice.png

This project builds upon the :ref:`ar_7_segment` project by adding a button to control the digit displayed on the seven-segment display.

The button is directly connected to IO13 without an external pull-up or pull-down resistor because IO13 has an internal pull-up resistor of 47K, eliminating the need for an additional external resistor.

**Code**

.. note::

    * Open the ``6.4_digital_dice.ino`` file under the path of ``esp32-starter-kit-main\c\codes\6.4_digital_dice``.
    * After selecting the board (ESP32 Dev Module) and the appropriate port, click the **Upload** button.

This project is based on :ref:`ar_7_segment` with a button to start/pause the scrolling display on the 7-segment Display.

When the button is pressed, the 7-segment display scrolls through the numbers 1-6, and when the button is released, it displays a random number.
