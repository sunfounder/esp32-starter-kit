.. _ar_dht11:


5.13 Temperature - Humidity
=======================================

The DHT11 is a temperature and humidity sensor commonly used for environmental measurements. It is a digital sensor that communicates with a microcontroller to provide temperature and humidity readings.

In this project, we will be reading the DHT11 sensor and printing out the temperature and humidity values it detects.

By reading the data provided by the sensor, we can obtain the current temperature and humidity values in the environment. These values can be used for real-time monitoring of environmental conditions, weather observations, indoor climate control, humidity reports, and more.

After the code is uploaded successfully, you will see the Serial Monitor continuously print out the temperature and humidity, and as the program runs steadily, these two values will become more and more accurate.

**How it works?**

#.  Includes the ``DHT.h`` library, which provides functions to interact with the DHT sensors. Then, set the pin and type for the DHT sensor.

    .. code-block:: arduino

        #include "DHT.h"

        #define DHTPIN 14  // Set the pin connected to the DHT11 data pin
        #define DHTTYPE DHT11 // DHT 11 

        DHT dht(DHTPIN, DHTTYPE);

#. Initializes serial communication at a baud rate of 115200 and initializes the DHT sensor.

    .. code-block:: arduino

        void setup() {
            Serial.begin(115200);
            Serial.println("DHT11 test!");
            dht.begin();
        }

#. In the ``loop()`` function, read temperature and humidity values from the DHT11 sensor, and print them to the serial monitor.

    .. code-block:: arduino

        void loop() {
            // Wait a few seconds between measurements.
            delay(2000);

            // Reading temperature or humidity takes about 250 milliseconds!
            // Sensor readings may also be up to 2 seconds 'old' (it's a very slow sensor)
            float humidity = dht.readHumidity();
            // Read temperature as Celsius (the default)
            float temperture = dht.readTemperature();

            // Check if any reads failed and exit early (to try again).
            if (isnan(humidity) || isnan(temperture)) {
                Serial.println("Failed to read from DHT sensor!");
                return;
            }
            // Print the humidity and temperature
            Serial.print("Humidity: "); 
            Serial.print(humidity);
            Serial.print(" %\t");
            Serial.print("Temperature: "); 
            Serial.print(temperture);
            Serial.println(" *C");
        }

    * The ``dht.readHumidity()`` function is called to read the humidity value from the DHT sensor.
    * The ``dht.readTemperature()`` function is called to read the temperature value from the DHT sensor.
    * The ``isnan()`` function is used to check if the readings are valid. If either the humidity or temperature value is NaN (not a number), it indicates a failed reading from the sensor, and an error message is printed.
