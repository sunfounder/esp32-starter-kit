4.2 Pumping
===================
In this intriguing project, we will delve into controlling a water pump using the L293D.

In the realm of water pump control, things are a bit simpler compared to controlling other motors. The beauty of this project lies in its simplicity - there's no need to worry about the direction of rotation. Our primary goal is to successfully activate the water pump and keep it running.

**Required Components**

In this project, we need the following components. 

It's definitely convenient to buy a whole kit, here's the link:

**Wiring**

.. note::

    It is recommended here to insert the battery and then slide the switch on the expansion board to the ON position to activate the battery supply.

**Code**

.. note::

  * You can open the file ``4.2_pump.ino`` under the path of ``esp32-starter-kit-main\c\codes\4.2_pump``. 
  * After selecting the board (ESP32 Dev Module) and the appropriate port, click the **Upload** button.

Connect the tubing to the pump and place it inside the water-filled container. Once the code has been successfully uploaded, you will observe the water in the container gradually being drained. During this experiment, please ensure that the electrical circuit is kept away from water to prevent short-circuiting!
