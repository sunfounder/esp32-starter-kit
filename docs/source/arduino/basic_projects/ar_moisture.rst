5.9 Measure Soil Moisture
==========================
This capacitive soil moisture sensor is different from most of the resistive sensors on the market, using the principle of capacitive induction to detect soil moisture.

By visually reading the values from the soil moisture sensor, we can gather information about the moisture level in the soil. This information is useful for various applications, such as automatic irrigation systems, plant health monitoring, or environmental sensing projects.

**Required Components**

In this project, we need the following components. 

It's definitely convenient to buy a whole kit, here's the link:

**Available Pins**

* **Available Pins**

    Here is a list of available pins on the ESP32 board for this project.

    .. list-table::
        :widths: 5 15

        *   - Available Pins
            - IO14, IO25, I35, I34, I39, I36


* **Strapping Pins**

    The following pins are strapping pins, which affect the startup process of the ESP32 during power on or reset. However, once the ESP32 is booted up successfully, they can be used as regular pins.

    .. list-table::
        :widths: 5 15

        *   - Strapping Pins
            - IO0, IO12

**Schematic**

.. image:: ../../img/circuit/circuit_5.9_soil_moisture.png

By inserting the module into the soil and watering it, the value read on I35 will decrease.

**Wiring**

**Code**

.. note::

    * Open the ``5.9_moisture.ino`` file under the path of ``esp32-starter-kit-main\c\codes\5.9_moisture``.
    * After selecting the board (ESP32 Dev Module) and the appropriate port, click the **Upload** button.

Remember to Set the serial communication baud rate to 115200.

Once the code is successfully uploaded, the serial monitor will print out the soil moisture value.

By inserting the module into the soil and watering it, the value of the soil moisture sensor will become smaller.
