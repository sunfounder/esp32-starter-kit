8.7 ESP Camera with Telegram Bot
====================================

In this project, we'll demonstrate how to integrate the ESP32 with your favorite messaging application. For this demonstration, we're using Telegram.

Create a Telegram Bot, allowing you to control your circuit from anywhere, capture photos, and manage the flash. Moreover, whenever someone passes by your device, it will snap a new photo and send a notification to your Telegram account.

**Required Components**

In this project, we need the following components. 

It's definitely convenient to buy a whole kit, here's the link:

**Creating a Telegram Bot**

#. Head to **Google Play** or the **App Store** and download and install **Telegram**.

#. Search for ``botfather`` in the **Telegram** app, and once it appears, click on it to open. or you can directly access this link: t.me/botfather.

    .. image:: img/sp230515_135927.png

#. Upon opening, you'll be presented with a chat window. Send the command ``/start``.

    .. image:: img/sp230515_140149.png

#. Enter ``/newbot`` and follow the provided instructions to create your bot. Once successful, the BotFather will provide you with the access link and API for your new bot.

**Authorizing Telegram Users**

As anyone can interact with the bot you've created, there's a risk of information leakage. To address this, we want the bot to only respond to authorized users.

#. In your **Telegram** account, search for ``IDBot`` or open the link: t.me/myidbot.

    .. image:: img/sp230515_144241.png

#. Send the command ``/getid``. Save the provided ID for later use in our program.

**Upload the Code**

#. First plug in the camera.

    .. raw:: html

        <video loop autoplay muted style = "max-width:100%">
            <source src="../../_static/video/plugin_camera.mp4" type="video/mp4">
            Your browser does not support the video tag.
        </video>

#. Build the circuit.

    .. image:: ../../img/wiring/iot_7_cam_telegram_bb.png
        
#. Open the code.

    * Open the ``iot_7_cam_telegram.ino`` file located in the ``esp32-starter-kit-main\c\codes\iot_7_cam_telegram`` directory, or copy the code into the Arduino IDE.
    * After selecting the board (ESP32 Dev Module) and the appropriate port, click the **Upload** button.
    * :ref:`unknown_com_port`
    * The ``UniversalTelegramBot`` and ``ArduinoJson`` libraries are used here, you can install them from the **Library Manager**.

#. Locate and modify the following lines with your WiFi details, replacing ``<SSID>`` and ``<PASSWORD>``:

    .. code-block::  Arduino

        // Replace the next variables with your SSID/Password combination
        const char* ssid = "<SSID>";
        const char* password = "<PASSWORD>";

5. Update the next line, replacing ``<CHATID>`` with your Telegram ID, which you obtained from @IDBot.

    .. code-block:: Arduino

        // Use @myidbot to find out the chat ID of an individual or a group
        // Also note that you need to click "start" on a bot before it can
        // message you
        String chatId = "<CHATID>";

#. Update the next line, substituting ``<BOTTOKEN>`` with the token of your Telegram BOT, which was provided by @BotFather.

    .. code-block:: Arduino

        // Initialize Telegram BOT
        String BOTtoken = "<BOTTOKEN>";

#. After selecting the correct board (ESP32 Dev Module) and port, click the **Upload** button.
#. Open the Serial Monitor. If an IP address is printed, this indicates successful execution. 

    .. code-block::

        Connecting to xxxx
        ESP32-CAM IP Address: 192.168.18.76
        Init Done!

#. Now, you can interact with your ESP32 via Telegram.
