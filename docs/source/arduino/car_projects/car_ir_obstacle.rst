5. Play with Obstacle Avoidance Module
===============================================

Two infrared obstacle avoidance modules are mounted on the front of the car, which can be used to detect some close obstacles.

In this project, the car is allowed to move forward freely, and when it encounters an obstacle it is able to avoid it and continue to move in other directions.

**Wiring**

The obstacle avoidance module is a distance-adjustable infrared proximity sensor whose output is normally high and low when an obstacle is detected.

Now build the circuit according to the diagram below.

**Adjust the Module**

Before starting the project, you need to adjust the detection distance of the module.

Wiring according to the above diagram, power up the R3 board (either by plugging in the USB cable directly or by snapping the 9V battery cable), without uploading the code.

Place a notebook or any other flat object about 5cm in front of the IR obstacle avoidance.

Then use a screwdriver to rotate the potentiometer on the module until the signal indicator on the module just lights up, so as to adjust its maximum detection distance of 5cm.

Follow the same method to adjust another infrared module.

**Code**

.. note::

    * Open the ``4.obstacle_avoidance_module.ino`` file under the path of ``3in1-kit\car_project\4.obstacle_avoidance_module``.
    * Or copy this code into **Arduino IDE**.
    
    * Or upload the code through the `Arduino Web Editor <https://docs.arduino.cc/cloud/web-editor/tutorials/getting-started/getting-started-web-editor>`_.

The car will move forward once the code has been successfully uploaded. When the left infrared module detects an obstacle, it will go backwards to the left; when the right infrared module detects an obstacle, it will go backwards to the right; if both sides detect an obstacle, it will go backwards squarely.

**How it works?**

This project is based on the value of the left and right infrared obstacle avoidance modules to make the car make the appropriate action.

#. Add the pin definition for the 2 obstacle avoidance modules, here they are set to ``INPUT``.

    .. code-block:: arduino

        ...
        const int rightIR = 7;
        const int leftIR = 8;

        void setup() {
        ...

        //IR obstacle
            pinMode(leftIR, INPUT);
            pinMode(rightIR, INPUT);
        }


#. Read the values of the left and right infrared modules and let the car to make the corresponding action.

    .. code-block:: arduino

        void loop() {

            int left = digitalRead(leftIR);   // 0: Obstructed  1: Empty
            int right = digitalRead(rightIR);
            int speed = 150;

            if (!left && right) {
                backLeft(speed);
            } else if (left && !right) {
                backRight(speed);
            } else if (!left && !right) {
                moveBackward(speed);
            } else {
                moveForward(speed);
            }
        }

    * If the left IR module is 0 (obstacle detected) and the right IR module is 1, let the car back up to the left.
    * If the right IR module is 0 (obstacle detected), let the car go back up to the right.
    * If 2 IR modules detect the obstacle at the same time, the car will go backward.
    * Otherwise the car will keep going forward.


#. About the ``backLeft()`` function.

    When the right motor is turning counterclockwise and the left motor is not turning, the car will go backward to the left. 

    .. code-block:: arduino

        void backLeft(int speed) {
            analogWrite(in1, speed);
            analogWrite(in2, 0);
            analogWrite(in3, 0);
            analogWrite(in4, 0);
        }

#. About the ``backLeft()`` function.

    When the left motor is turning clockwise and the right motor is not turning, the car will go backward to the right.

    .. code-block:: arduino

        void backRight(int speed) {
            analogWrite(in1, 0);
            analogWrite(in2, 0);
            analogWrite(in3, 0);
            analogWrite(in4, speed);
        }

* `&& <https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/structure/boolean-operators/logicaland/>`_: Logical AND results in true only if both operands are true.

* `! <https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/structure/boolean-operators/logicalnot/>`_: Logical NOT results in a true if the operand is false and vice versa.
