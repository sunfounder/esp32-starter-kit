1.4 How to upload Sketch to the Board?
=============================================

In this section, you will learn how to upload the sketch created previously to the Arduino board, as well as learn about some considerations.

**1. Choose Board and port**

Arduino development boards usually come with a USB cable. You can use it to connect the board to your computer.

Select the correct **Board** and **Port** in the Arduino IDE. Normally, Arduino boards are recognized automatically by the computer and assigned a port, so you can select it here.

If your board is already plugged in, but not recognized, check if the **INSTALLED** logo appears in the **Arduino AVR Boards** section of the **Boards Manager**, if not, please scroll down a bit and click on **INSTALL**.

Reopening the Arduino IDE and re-plugging the Arduino board will fix most of the problems. You can also click **Tools** -> **Board** or **Port** to select them.


**2. Verify the Sketch**

After clicking the Verify button, the sketch will be compiled to see if there are any errors.

You can use it to find mistakes if you delete some characters or type a few letters by mistake. From the message bar, you can see where and what type of errors occurred.

If there are no errors, you will see a message like the one below.

The Arduino board will automatically run the sketch after power is applied after the sketch is uploaded. The running program can be overwritten by uploading a new sketch.
